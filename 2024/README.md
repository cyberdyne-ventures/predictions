## 2024 Prediction Search Space Reduction

In the final 2024 run, the model identified 13,031 CVEs likely to go hot out of 34.582. This is a 62% decrease in CVEs to look at, which is good, but the numbers can be further reduced. 

The reductions file has 4238 predictions and contains 82% of the watchlisted CVEs for calendar 2024. This means considering just 12% of the 2024 CVEs, an 82% reduction from the total CVE set for theat year.

This works out to an average of 353 per month versus 2882 per month for us to analyze while still enjoying early warnings. Considering that most organizations can still further reduce that number, by ignoring CVEs from software titles or versions they are not using, it becomes a very signficant time and effort savings. This set is in the file named reduction.txt.
