x86/mm/ident_map: Use gbpages only where full GB page should be mapped.

When ident_pud_init() uses only GB pages to create identity maps, large
ranges of addresses not actually requested can be included in the resulting
table; a 4K request will map a full GB.  This can include a lot of extra
address space past that requested, including areas marked reserved by the
BIOS.  That allows processor speculation into reserved regions, that on UV
systems can cause system halts.

Only use GB pages when map creation requests include the full GB page of
space.  Fall back to using smaller 2M pages when only portions of a GB page
are included in the request.

No attempt is made to coalesce mapping requests. If a request requires a
map entry at the 2M (pmd) level, subsequent mapping requests within the
same 1G region will also be at the pmd level, even if adjacent or
overlapping such requests could have been combined to map a full GB page.
Existing usage starts with larger regions and then adds smaller regions, so

When the device control plane is removed or the platform
running device control plane is rebooted, a reset is detected

waits for the reset to complete. If the reset fails, it takes

swiotlb: Fix double-allocation of slots due to broken alignment handling

Commit bbb73a103fbb (""swiotlb: fix a braino in the alignment check fix""),
which was a fix for commit 0eee5ae10256 (""swiotlb: fix slot alignment
checks""), causes a functional regression with vsock in a virtual machine
using bouncing via a restricted DMA SWIOTLB pool.

When virtio allocates the virtqueues for the vsock device using
dma_alloc_coherent(), the SWIOTLB search can return page-unaligned
allocations if 'area->index' was left unaligned by a previous allocation
from the buffer:

 # Final address in brackets is the SWIOTLB address returned to the caller
 | virtio-pci 0000:00:07.0: orig_addr 0x0 alloc_size 0x2000, iotlb_align_mask 0x800 stride 0x2: got slot 1645-1649/7168 (0x98326800)
 | virtio-pci 0000:00:07.0: orig_addr 0x0 alloc_size 0x2000, iotlb_align_mask 0x800 stride 0x2: got slot 1649-1653/7168 (0x98328800)
 | virtio-pci 0000:00:07.0: orig_addr 0x0 alloc_size 0x2000, iotlb_align_mask 0x800 stride 0x2: got slot 1653-1657/7168 (0x9832a800)

This ends badly (typically buffer corruption and/or a hang) because
swiotlb_alloc() is expecting a page-aligned allocation and so blindly
returns a pointer to the 'struct page' corresponding to the allocation,
therefore double-allocating the first half (2KiB slot) of the 4KiB page.

Fix the problem by treating the allocation alignment separately to any
additional alignment requirements from the device, using the maximum
of the two as the stride to search the buffer slots and taking care
to ensure a minimum of page-alignment for buffers larger than a page.

This also resolves swiotlb allocation failures occuring due to the
inclusion of ~PAGE_MASK in 'iotlb_align_mask' for large allocations and
resulting in alignment requirements exceeding swiotlb_max_mapping_size()."	hot

iommu/vt-d: Use device rbtree in iopf reporting path

The existing I/O page fault handler currently locates the PCI device by
calling pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot(). This function searches the list

efficiency, replace it with device_rbtree_find() to search the device
within the probed device rbtree.

The I/O page fault is initiated by the device, which does not have any
synchronization mechanism with the software to ensure that the device
stays in the probed device tree. Theoretically, a device could be released
by the IOMMU subsystem after device_rbtree_find() and before
iopf_get_dev_fault_param(), which would cause a use-after-free problem.

firmware: qcom: uefisecapp: Fix memory related IO errors and crashes

It turns out that while the QSEECOM APP_SEND command has specific fields
for request and response buffers, uefisecapp expects them both to be in
a single memory region. Failure to adhere to this has (so far) resulted
in either no response being written to the response buffer (causing an
EIO to be emitted down the line), the SCM call to fail with EINVAL
(i.e., directly from TZ/firmware), or the device to be hard-reset.

While this issue can be triggered deterministically, in the current form
it seems to happen rather sporadically (which is why it has gone
unnoticed during earlier testing). This is likely due to the two
kzalloc() calls (for request and response) being directly after each
other. Which means that those likely return consecutive regions most of
the time, especially when not much else is going on in the system.

Fix this by allocating a single memory region for both request and
response buffers, properly aligning both structs inside it. This
unfortunately also means that the qcom_scm_qseecom_app_send() interface
needs to be restructured, as it should no longer map the DMA regions
separately. Therefore, move the responsibility of DMA allocation (or
mapping) to the caller."	hot

CVE-2024-35235	OpenPrinting	cups	"OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. In versions 2.4.8 and earlier, when starting the cupsd server with a Listen configuration item pointing to a symbolic link, the cupsd process can be caused to perform an arbitrary chmod of the provided argument, providing world-writable access to the target. Given that cupsd is often running as root, this can result in the change of permission of any user or system files to be world writable. Given the aforementioned Ubuntu AppArmor context, on such systems this vulnerability is limited to those files modifiable by the cupsd process. In that specific case it was found to be possible to turn the configuration of the Listen argument into full control over the cupsd.conf and cups-files.conf configuration files. By later setting the User and Group arguments in cups-files.conf, and printing with a printer configured by PPD with a `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` argument, arbitrary user and group (not root) command execution could be achieved, which can further be used on Ubuntu systems to achieve full root command execution.

fpga: region: add owner module and take its refcount

The current implementation of the fpga region assumes that the low-level
module registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer
to take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it can
lead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the region
during programming if the parent device does not have a driver.

To address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_region
struct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the functions for
registering a region to take an additional owner module parameter and
rename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old function names for helper
macros that automatically set the module that registers the region as the
owner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules
and reduces the chances of registering a region without setting the owner.

pdsc_stop_health_thread(), which attempts to stop/flush the health

bpf: support deferring bpf_link dealloc to after RCU grace period

BPF link for some program types is passed as a ""context"" which can be
used by those BPF programs to look up additional information. E.g., for
multi-kprobes and multi-uprobes, link is used to fetch BPF cookie values.

Because of this runtime dependency, when bpf_link refcnt drops to zero
there could still be active BPF programs running accessing link data.

This patch adds generic support to defer bpf_link dealloc callback to
after RCU GP, if requested. This is done by exposing two different
deallocation callbacks, one synchronous and one deferred. If deferred
one is provided, bpf_link_free() will schedule dealloc_deferred()
callback to happen after RCU GP.

BPF is using two flavors of RCU: ""classic"" non-sleepable one and RCU
tasks trace one. The latter is used when sleepable BPF programs are
used. bpf_link_free() accommodates that by checking underlying BPF
program's sleepable flag, and goes either through normal RCU GP only for
non-sleepable, or through RCU tasks trace GP *and* then normal RCU GP
(taking into account rcu_trace_implies_rcu_gp() optimization), if BPF
program is sleepable.

We use this for multi-kprobe and multi-uprobe links, which dereference
link during program run. We also preventively switch raw_tp link to use
deferred dealloc callback, as upcoming changes in bpf-next tree expose
raw_tp link data (specifically, cookie value) to BPF program at runtime
as well."	hot

ax25: Fix refcount imbalance on inbound connections

When releasing a socket in ax25_release(), we call netdev_put() to
decrease the refcount on the associated ax.25 device. However, the
execution path for accepting an incoming connection never calls
netdev_hold(). This imbalance leads to refcount errors, and ultimately
to kernel crashes.

A typical call trace for the above situation will start with one of the
following errors:

    refcount_t: decrement hit 0; leaking memory.
    refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.

And will then have a trace like:

On reboot (or any attempt to remove the interface), the kernel gets
stuck in an infinite loop:

    unregister_netdevice: waiting for ax0 to become free. Usage count = 0

This patch corrects these issues by ensuring that we call netdev_hold()
and ax25_dev_hold() for new connections in ax25_accept(). This makes the
logic leading to ax25_accept() match the logic for ax25_bind(): in both
cases we increment the refcount, which is ultimately decremented in

CVE-2024-31214	traccar	traccar	"Traccar is an open source GPS tracking system. Traccar versions 5.1 through 5.12 allow arbitrary files to be uploaded through the device image upload API. Attackers have full control over the file contents, full control over the directory where the file is stored, full control over the file extension, and partial control over the file name. While it's not  for an attacker to overwrite an existing file, an attacker can create new files with certain names and attacker-controlled extensions anywhere on the file system. This can potentially lead to remote code execution, XSS, DOS, etc. The default install of Traccar makes this vulnerability more severe. Self-registration is enabled by default, allowing anyone to create an account to exploit this vulnerability. Traccar also runs by default with root/system privileges, allowing files to be placed anywhere on the file system. Version 6.0 contains a fix for the issue. One may also turn off self-registration by default, as that would make most vulnerabilities in the application much harder to exploit by default and reduce the severity considerably.

CVE-2024-44951	Linux	Linux	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: sc16is7xx: fix TX fifo corruption

Sometimes, when a packet is received on channel A at almost the same time
as a packet is about to be transmitted on channel B, we observe with a
logic analyzer that the received packet on channel A is transmitted on
channel B. In other words, the Tx buffer data on channel B is corrupted
with data from channel A.

The problem appeared since commit 4409df5866b7 (""serial: sc16is7xx: change
EFR lock to operate on each channels""), which changed the EFR locking to
operate on each channel instead of chip-wise.

This commit has introduced a regression, because the EFR lock is used not
only to protect the EFR registers access, but also, in a very obscure and
undocumented way, to protect access to the data buffer, which is shared by
the Tx and Rx handlers, but also by each channel of the IC.

Fix this regression first by switching to kfifo_out_linear_ptr() in
sc16is7xx_handle_tx() to eliminate the need for a shared Rx/Tx buffer.

Secondly, replace the chip-wise Rx buffer with a separate Rx buffer for
each channel."	hot

CVE-2024-21585	Juniper Networks	Junos OS	"
An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in BGP session processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker, using specific timing outside the attacker's control, to flap BGP sessions and cause the routing protocol daemon (rpd) process to crash and restart, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Continued BGP session flapping will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue only affects routers configured with non-stop routing (NSR) enabled. Graceful Restart (GR) helper mode, enabled by default, is also required for this issue to be exploitable.


Note: NSR is not supported on the SRX Series and is therefore not affected by this vulnerability.
When the BGP session flaps on the NSR-enabled router, the device enters GR-helper/LLGR-helper mode due to the peer having negotiated GR/LLGR-restarter capability and the backup BGP requests for replication of the GR/LLGR-helper session, master BGP schedules, and initiates replication of GR/LLGR stale routes to the backup BGP. In this state, if the BGP session with the BGP peer comes up again, unsolicited replication is initiated for the peer without cleaning up the ongoing GR/LLGR-helper mode replication. This parallel two instances of replication for the same peer leads to the assert if the BGP session flaps again.

CVE-2024-21602	Juniper Networks	Junos OS Evolved	"
A NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX7024, ACX7100-32C and ACX7100-48L allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

If a specific IPv4 UDP packet is received and sent to the Routing Engine (RE) packetio crashes and restarts which causes a momentary traffic interruption. Continued receipt of such packets will lead to a sustained DoS.

This issue does not happen with IPv6 packets.

This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX7024, ACX7100-32C and ACX7100-48L:



  *  21.4-EVO versions earlier than 21.4R3-S6-EVO;

CVE-2024-45022	Linux	Linux	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/vmalloc: fix page mapping if vm_area_alloc_pages() with high order fallback to order 0

The __vmap_pages_range_noflush() assumes its argument pages** contains
pages with the same page shift.  However, since commit e9c3cda4d86e (""mm,
vmalloc: fix high order __GFP_NOFAIL allocations""), if gfp_flags includes
__GFP_NOFAIL with high order in vm_area_alloc_pages() and page allocation
failed for high order, the pages** may contain two different page shifts
(high order and order-0).  This could lead __vmap_pages_range_noflush() to
perform incorrect mappings, potentially resulting in memory corruption.

Users might encounter this as follows (vmap_allow_huge = true, 2M is for
PMD_SIZE):

kvmalloc(2M, __GFP_NOFAIL|GFP_X)
    __vmalloc_node_range_noprof(vm_flags=VM_ALLOW_HUGE_VMAP)
        vm_area_alloc_pages(order=9) ---> order-9 allocation failed and fallback to order-0

                    __vmap_pages_range_noflush(page_shift = 21) ----> wrong mapping happens

We can remove the fallback code because if a high-order allocation fails,
__vmalloc_node_range_noprof() will retry with order-0.  Therefore, it is
unnecessary to fallback to order-0 here.  Therefore, fix this by removing
the fallback code."	hot

The usage of `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` and `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` allows an external dynamic library to be injected into the application using DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable. 
Moreover, the entitlement `com.apple.security.device.camera` allows the application to use the host camera and `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` allows the application to use the microphone. This means that untrusted code that is executed on the user's machine can access the camera or the microphone, if the user has already given permission for Cursor to do so. In version 0.41.0, the entitlements have been split by process: the main process gets the camera and microphone entitlements, but not the DyLib entitlements, whereas the extension host process gets the DyLib entitlements but not the camera or microphone entitlements.

CVE-2024-45004	Linux	Linux	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KEYS: trusted: dcp: fix leak of blob encryption key

Trusted keys unseal the key blob on load, but keep the sealed payload in
the blob field so that every subsequent read (export) will simply
convert this field to hex and send it to userspace.

With DCP-based trusted keys, we decrypt the blob encryption key (BEK)
in the Kernel due hardware limitations and then decrypt the blob payload.
BEK decryption is done in-place which means that the trusted key blob
field is modified and it consequently holds the BEK in plain text.
Every subsequent read of that key thus send the plain text BEK instead
of the encrypted BEK to userspace.

This issue only occurs when importing a trusted DCP-based key and
then exporting it again. This should rarely happen as the common use cases
are to either create a new trusted key and export it, or import a key
blob and then just use it without exporting it again.

Fix this by performing BEK decryption and encryption in a dedicated
buffer. Further always wipe the plain text BEK buffer to prevent leaking
the key via uninitialized memory."	hot

There is a bug in netem_enqueue() introduced by

skipped on the parent during destruction, leaving a dangling pointer

There are two ways for the bug happen:

- If the duplicated packet is dropped by rootq->enqueue() and then
  the original packet is also dropped.
- If rootq->enqueue() sends the duplicated packet to a different qdisc
  and the original packet is dropped.

In both cases NET_XMIT_SUCCESS is returned even though no packets

In this configuration, composed by a key-value format, the plugin fails to escape special characters, leading the application to interpret values as keys. One of the most critical parameters that could be abused by a malicious user is the `leftupdown`key. This key takes an executable command as a value and is used to specify what executes as a callback in NetworkManager-libreswan to retrieve configuration settings back to NetworkManager. As NetworkManager uses Polkit to allow an unprivileged user to control the system's network configuration, a malicious actor could achieve local privilege escalation and potential code execution as root in the targeted machine by creating a malicious configuration."	hot

The `FirmwareController` class does however not perform any session id checks, thus this feature can be accessed without a valid session. Due to this issue, attackers can gain remote code execution as root user, allowing a full system compromise. Version 3.75.6.20240316 contains a patch."	hot

If GeoServer is also deployed as a web archive using the data directory embedded in the `geoserver.war` file (rather than an external data directory), it will likely be possible to read specific resources to gain administrator privileges. However, it is very unlikely that production environments will be using the embedded data directory since, depending on how GeoServer is deployed, it will be erased and re-installed (which would also reset to the default password) either every time the server restarts or every time a new GeoServer WAR is installed and is therefore difficult to maintain. An external data directory will always be used if GeoServer is running in standalone mode (via an installer or a binary). Versions 2.23.5 and 2.24.3 contain a patch for the issue. Some workarounds are available. One may change from a Windows environment to a Linux environment; or change from Apache Tomcat to Jetty application server.

filelock: Remove locks reliably when fcntl/close race is detected

When fcntl_setlk() races with close(), it removes the created lock with

However, LSMs can allow the first do_lock_file_wait() that created the lock
while denying the second do_lock_file_wait() that tries to remove the lock.
Separately, posix_lock_file() could also fail to
remove a lock due to GFP_KERNEL allocation failure (when splitting a range

After the bug has been triggered, use-after-free reads will occur in
lock_get_status() when userspace reads /proc/locks. This can likely be used

When it runs, it will download an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow and assign the contents of ./pr_num/pr_num.txt artifact to the steps.pr_num_reader.outputs.content WorkFlow variable. It is not validated that the variable is actually a number and later it is interpolated into a JS script allowing an attacker to change the code to be executed. This issue leads to pull-requests write access. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.30.0."	hot

powerpc/mm/fault: Fix kfence page fault reporting

copy_from_kernel_nofault() can be called when doing read of /proc/kcore.
/proc/kcore can have some unmapped kfence objects which when read via
copy_from_kernel_nofault() can cause page faults. Since *_nofault()
functions define their own fixup table for handling fault, use that
instead of asking kfence to handle such faults.

Hence we search the exception tables for the nip which generated the
fault. If there is an entry then we let the fixup table handler handle the
page fault by returning an error from within ___do_page_fault().

This can be easily triggered if someone tries to do dd from /proc/kcore.
eg. dd if=/proc/kcore of=/dev/null bs=1M

nilfs2: fix potential out-of-bounds memory access in nilfs_find_entry()

Syzbot reported that when searching for records in a directory where the
inode's i_size is corrupted and has a large value, memory access outside
the folio/page range may occur, or a use-after-free bug may be detected if
KASAN is enabled.

This is because nilfs_last_byte(), which is called by nilfs_find_entry()
and others to calculate the number of valid bytes of directory data in a
page from i_size and the page index, loses the upper 32 bits of the 64-bit
size information due to an inappropriate type of local variable to which
the i_size value is assigned.

This caused a large byte offset value due to underflow in the end address
calculation in the calling nilfs_find_entry(), resulting in memory access
that exceeds the folio/page size.

Fix this issue by changing the type of the local variable causing the bit
loss from ""unsigned int"" to ""u64"".  The return value of nilfs_last_byte()
is also of type ""unsigned int"", but it is truncated so as not to exceed
PAGE_SIZE and no bit loss occurs, so no change is required."	hot

buffer_head read fault injection. The actual completion of buffer_head
read and the buffer_head fault injection are not atomic, which can lead
to the uptodate flag being cleared on normally used buffer_heads in race
conditions.

The best approach would be to perform fault injection in the IO completion
callback function, rather than after IO completion. However, the IO
completion callback function cannot get the fault injection code in sb.

Fix it by passing the result of fault injection into the bh read function,
we simulate faults within the bh read function itself. This requires adding
an extra parameter to the bh read functions that need fault injection."	hot

Fix by adding checks for the MBX_TIMEOUT return code.  During mailbox
resource cleanup, check the mbox flag to make sure that the wait did not
timeout.  If the MBOX_WAKE flag is not set, then do not free the resources
because it will be freed when firmware completes the mailbox at a later

is accessed by the rpmsg/glink callback, which in turn is invoked from

This means that ucsi_unregister() is now called from atomic context,
which isn't feasible as it's expecting a sleepable context. An effort is
under way to get GLINK to invoke its callbacks in a sleepable context,

A side effect of this is that ucsi_unregister() can now happen
after the remote processor, and thereby the communication link with it, is
gone. pmic_glink_send() is amended with a check to avoid the resulting NULL
pointer dereference.

thunderbolt: Mark XDomain as unplugged when router is removed

I noticed that when we do discrete host router NVM upgrade and it gets
hot-removed from the PCIe side as a result of NVM firmware authentication,
if there is another host connected with enabled paths we hang in tearing
them down. This is due to fact that the Thunderbolt networking driver
also tries to cleanup the paths and ends up blocking in
tb_disconnect_xdomain_paths() waiting for the domain lock.

However, at this point we already cleaned the paths in tb_stop() so
there is really no need for tb_disconnect_xdomain_paths() to do that
anymore. Furthermore it already checks if the XDomain is unplugged and
bails out early so take advantage of that and mark the XDomain as
unplugged when we remove the parent router."	hot

[Why]
DMCUB can intermittently take longer than expected to process commands.

Old ASIC policy was to continue while logging a diagnostic error - which
works fine for ASIC without IPS, but with IPS this could lead to a race
condition where we attempt to access DCN state while it's inaccessible,
leading to a system hang when the NIU port is not disabled or register
accesses that timeout and the display configuration in an undefined
state.

[How]
We need to investigate why these accesses take longer than expected, but
for now we should disable the timeout on DCN35 to avoid this race
condition. Since the waits happen only at lower interrupt levels the
risk of taking too long at higher IRQ and causing a system watchdog
timeout are minimal."	hot

Developers connect to remote codespaces through an SSH server running within the devcontainer, which is generally provided through the [default devcontainer image]( https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-... https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#using-the-default-dev-container-configuration) .

This exploit occurs when a malicious third-party devcontainer contains a modified SSH server that injects `ssh` arguments within the SSH connection details. `gh codespace ssh` and `gh codespace logs` commands could execute arbitrary code on the user's workstation if the remote username contains something like `-oProxyCommand=""echo hacked"" #`.  The `-oProxyCommand` flag causes `ssh` to execute the provided command while `#` shell comment causes any other `ssh` arguments to be ignored.

CVE-2024-37293	awslabs	aws-deployment-framework	"The AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) is a framework to manage and deploy resources across multiple AWS accounts and regions within an AWS Organization. ADF allows for staged, parallel, multi-account, cross-region deployments of applications or resources via the structure defined in AWS Organizations while taking advantage of services such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeCommit to alleviate the heavy lifting and management compared to a traditional CI/CD setup. ADF contains a bootstrap process that is responsible to deploy ADF's bootstrap stacks to facilitate multi-account cross-region deployments. The ADF bootstrap process relies on elevated privileges to perform this task. Two versions of the bootstrap process exist; a code-change driven pipeline using AWS CodeBuild and an event-driven state machine using AWS Lambda. If an actor has permissions to change the behavior of the CodeBuild project or the Lambda function, they would be able to escalate their privileges.

Prior to version 4.0.0, the bootstrap CodeBuild role provides access to the `sts:AssumeRole` operation without further restrictions. Therefore, it is able to assume into any AWS Account in the AWS Organization with the elevated privileges provided by the cross-account access role. By default, this role is not restricted when it is created by AWS Organizations, providing Administrator level access to the AWS resources in the AWS Account. The patches for this issue are included in `aws-deployment-framework` version 4.0.0.

As a temporary mitigation, add a permissions boundary to the roles created by ADF in the management account. The permissions boundary should deny all IAM and STS actions. This permissions boundary should be in place until you upgrade ADF or bootstrap a new account. While the permissions boundary is in place, the account management and bootstrapping of accounts are unable to create, update, or assume into roles. This mitigates the privilege escalation risk, but also disables ADF's ability to create, manage, and bootstrap accounts."	hot

CVE-2024-37021	Linux	Linux	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fpga: manager: add owner module and take its refcount

The current implementation of the fpga manager assumes that the low-level
module registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer
to take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it can
lead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the manager if
the parent device does not have a driver.

To address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_manager
struct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the functions for
registering the manager to take an additional owner module parameter and
rename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old function names for helper
macros that automatically set the module that registers the manager as the
owner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules
and reduces the chances of registering a manager without setting the owner.

Also, update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface
for registering an fpga manager.

Other changes: opportunistically move put_device() from __fpga_mgr_get() to
fpga_mgr_get() and of_fpga_mgr_get() to improve code clarity since the
manager device is taken in these functions."	hot

USB: usb-storage: Prevent divide-by-0 error in isd200_ata_command

The isd200 sub-driver in usb-storage uses the HEADS and SECTORS values
in the ATA ID information to calculate cylinder and head values when
creating a CDB for READ or WRITE commands.  The calculation involves
division and modulus operations, which will cause a crash if either of

could happen with a flawed or subversive emulation, as reported by the

Protect against this possibility by refusing to bind to the device if
either the ATA_ID_HEADS or ATA_ID_SECTORS value in the device's ID

CVE-2024-27933	denoland	deno	"Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. In version 1.39.0, use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors, allowing standard input to be re-opened as a different resource resulting in permission prompt bypass. Node child_process IPC relies on the JS side to pass the raw IPC file descriptor to `op_node_ipc_pipe()`, which returns a `IpcJsonStreamResource` ID associated with the file descriptor. On closing the resource, the raw file descriptor is closed together.

Use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors. This allow standard input (fd 0) to be closed and re-opened for a different resource, which allows a silent permission prompt bypass. This is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions.

This bug is known to be exploitable. There is a working exploit that achieves arbitrary code execution by bypassing prompts from zero permissions, additionally abusing the fact that Cache API lacks filesystem permission checks. The attack can be conducted silently as stderr can also be closed, suppressing all prompt outputs.

Version 1.39.1 fixes the bug.

ASoC: SOF: ipc4-pcm: Workaround for crashed firmware on system suspend

When the system is suspended while audio is active, the
sof_ipc4_pcm_hw_free() is invoked to reset the pipelines since during
suspend the DSP is turned off, streams will be re-started after resume.

If the firmware crashes during while audio is running (or when we reset
the stream before suspend) then the sof_ipc4_set_multi_pipeline_state()
will fail with IPC error and the state change is interrupted.
This will cause misalignment between the kernel and firmware state on next
DSP boot resulting errors returned by firmware for IPC messages, eventually
failing the audio resume.
On stream close the errors are ignored so the kernel state will be
corrected on the next DSP boot, so the second boot after the DSP panic.

If sof_ipc4_trigger_pipelines() is called from sof_ipc4_pcm_hw_free() then
state parameter is SOF_IPC4_PIPE_RESET and only in this case.

Treat a forced pipeline reset similarly to how we treat a pcm_free by
ignoring error on state sending to allow the kernel's state to be

should use zone_size (= data_sinfo->chunk_size) as it is.

arm64: mm: Fix lockless walks with static and dynamic page-table folding

Lina reports random oopsen originating from the fast GUP code when
16K pages are used with 4-level page-tables, the fourth level being
folded at runtime due to lack of LPA2.

In this configuration, the generic implementation of
p4d_offset_lockless() will return a 'p4d_t *' corresponding to the
'pgd_t' allocated on the stack of the caller, gup_fast_pgd_range().
This is normally fine, but when the fourth level of page-table is folded
at runtime, pud_offset_lockless() will offset from the address of the
'p4d_t' to calculate the address of the PUD in the same page-table page.
This results in a stray stack read when the 'p4d_t' has been allocated
on the stack and can send the walker into the weeds.

Fix the problem by providing our own definition of p4d_offset_lockless()
when CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS <= 4 which returns the real page-table

net, sunrpc: Remap EPERM in case of connection failure in xs_tcp_setup_socket

When using a BPF program on kernel_connect(), the call can return -EPERM. This
causes xs_tcp_setup_socket() to loop forever, filling up the syslog and causing
the kernel to potentially freeze up.

Neil suggested:

  This will propagate -EPERM up into other layers which might not be ready
  to handle it. It might be safer to map EPERM to an error we would be more
  likely to expect from the network system - such as ECONNREFUSED or ENETDOWN.

ECONNREFUSED as error seems reasonable. For programs setting a different error
can be out of reach (see handling in 4fbac77d2d09) in particular on kernels
which do not have f10d05966196 (""bpf: Make BPF_PROG_RUN_ARRAY return -err
instead of allow boolean""), thus given that it is better to simply remap for
consistent behavior. UDP does handle EPERM in xs_udp_send_request()."	hot

As user-space applications extract packets from this list, the rate

to potential list overflow.

To address this, we introduce a limit to the size of the list. After
considering typical scenarios, such as OpenSM processing, which can
handle approximately 100k packets per second, and the 1-second retry
timeout for most packets, we set the list size limit to 200k. Packets

timed-out sends are preserved even when the list is full."	hot

CVE-2024-42105	Linux	Linux	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix inode number range checks

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix potential issues related to reserved inodes"".

This series fixes one use-after-free issue reported by syzbot, caused by
nilfs2's internal inode being exposed in the namespace on a corrupted
filesystem, and a couple of flaws that cause problems if the starting
number of non-reserved inodes written in the on-disk super block is
intentionally (or corruptly) changed from its default value.  


This patch (of 3):

In the current implementation of nilfs2, ""nilfs->ns_first_ino"", which
gives the first non-reserved inode number, is read from the superblock,
but its lower limit is not checked.

As a result, if a number that overlaps with the inode number range of
reserved inodes such as the root directory or metadata files is set in the
super block parameter, the inode number test macros (NILFS_MDT_INODE and
NILFS_VALID_INODE) will not function properly.

In addition, these test macros use left bit-shift calculations using with
the inode number as the shift count via the BIT macro, but the result of a
shift calculation that exceeds the bit width of an integer is undefined in
the C specification, so if ""ns_first_ino"" is set to a large value other
than the default value NILFS_USER_INO (=11), the macros may potentially
malfunction depending on the environment.

Fix these issues by checking the lower bound of ""nilfs->ns_first_ino"" and
by preventing bit shifts equal to or greater than the NILFS_USER_INO
constant in the inode number test macros.

Also, change the type of ""ns_first_ino"" from signed integer to unsigned
integer to avoid the need for type casting in comparisons such as the
lower bound check introduced this time."	hot

The cause is due to the idxd driver interrupt completion handler uses
threaded interrupt and the threaded handler is not hard or soft interrupt
context. However __netif_rx() can only be called from interrupt context.
Change the call to netif_rx() in order to allow completion via normal
context for dmaengine drivers that utilize threaded irq handling.

While the following commit changed from netif_rx() to __netif_rx(),
baebdf48c360 (""net: dev: Makes sure netif_rx() can be invoked in any context.""),
the change should've been a noop instead. However, the code precedes this
fix should've been using netif_rx_ni() or netif_rx_any_context()."	hot

ksmbd: fix use-after-free in SMB request handling

A race condition exists between SMB request handling in
`ksmbd_conn_handler_loop()` and the freeing of `ksmbd_conn` in the
workqueue handler `handle_ksmbd_work()`. This leads to a UAF.
- KASAN: slab-use-after-free Read in handle_ksmbd_work
- KASAN: slab-use-after-free in rtlock_slowlock_locked

This race condition arises as follows:
- `ksmbd_conn_handler_loop()` waits for `conn->r_count` to reach zero:
  `wait_event(conn->r_count_q, atomic_read(&conn->r_count) == 0);`
- Meanwhile, `handle_ksmbd_work()` decrements `conn->r_count` using
  `atomic_dec_return(&conn->r_count)`, and if it reaches zero, calls
  `ksmbd_conn_free()`, which frees `conn`.
- However, after `handle_ksmbd_work()` decrements `conn->r_count`,
  it may still access `conn->r_count_q` in the following line:
  `waitqueue_active(&conn->r_count_q)` or `wake_up(&conn->r_count_q)`

Since affected quic-go versions used IP_PMTUDISC_DO, the kernel would then return a ""message too large"" error on sendmsg, i.e. when quic-go attempts to send a packet that exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet. By setting this value to smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC), the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially, this can be done after completion of the handshake, thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example, many browsers fall back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection). The attacker needs to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.2."	hot

CVE-2024-53192	Linux	Linux	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: clk-loongson2: Fix potential buffer overflow in flexible-array member access

Flexible-array member `hws` in `struct clk_hw_onecell_data` is annotated
with the `counted_by()` attribute. This means that when memory is
allocated for this array, the _counter_, which in this case is member
`num` in the flexible structure, should be set to the maximum number of
elements the flexible array can contain, or fewer.

In this case, the total number of elements for the flexible array is
determined by variable `clks_num` when allocating heap space via
`devm_kzalloc()`, as shown below:

289         struct loongson2_clk_provider *clp;
	...
296         for (p = data; p->name; p++)
297                 clks_num++;
298
299         clp = devm_kzalloc(dev, struct_size(clp, clk_data.hws, clks_num),
300                            GFP_KERNEL);

So, `clp->clk_data.num` should be set to `clks_num` or less, and not
exceed `clks_num`, as is currently the case. Otherwise, if data is
written into `clp->clk_data.hws[clks_num]`, the instrumentation
provided by the compiler won't detect the overflow, leading to a
memory corruption bug at runtime.

Fix this issue by setting `clp->clk_data.num` to `clks_num`."	hot

A path traversal vulnerability exists in the backup export functionality of EDDI, as implemented in `RestExportService.java`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access sensitive files on the server by manipulating the `botFilename` parameter in requests. The application fails to sanitize user input, enabling malicious inputs such as `..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd` to access arbitrary files. However, the **severity of this vulnerability is significantly limited** because EDDI typically runs within a **Docker container**, which provides additional layers of isolation and restricted permissions. As a result, while this vulnerability exposes files within the container, it does not inherently threaten the underlying host system or other containers. A patch is required to sanitize and validate the botFilename input parameter. Users should ensure they are using version 5.4 which contains this patdch.

smb: During unmount, ensure all cached dir instances drop their dentry

The unmount process (cifs_kill_sb() calling close_all_cached_dirs()) can
race with various cached directory operations, which ultimately results
in dentries not being dropped and these kernel BUGs:

BUG: Dentry ffff88814f37e358{i=1000000000080,n=/}  still in use (2) [unmount of cifs cifs]
VFS: Busy inodes after unmount of cifs (cifs)
------------[ cut here ]------------
kernel BUG at fs/super.c:661!

This happens when a cfid is in the process of being cleaned up when, and
has been removed from the cfids->entries list, including:

- Receiving a lease break from the server
- Server reconnection triggers invalidate_all_cached_dirs(), which
  removes all the cfids from the list
- The laundromat thread decides to expire an old cfid.

To solve these problems, dropping the dentry is done in queued work done
in a newly-added cfid_put_wq workqueue, and close_all_cached_dirs()
flushes that workqueue after it drops all the dentries of which it's
aware. This is a global workqueue (rather than scoped to a mount), but
the queued work is minimal.

The final cleanup work for cleaning up a cfid is performed via work
queued in the serverclose_wq workqueue; this is done separate from
dropping the dentries so that close_all_cached_dirs() doesn't block on
any server operations.

Both of these queued works expect to invoked with a cfid reference and
a tcon reference to avoid those objects from being freed while the work
is ongoing.

While we're here, add proper locking to close_all_cached_dirs(), and
locking around the freeing of cfid->dentry."	hot

CVE-2024-36479	Linux	Linux	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fpga: bridge: add owner module and take its refcount

The current implementation of the fpga bridge assumes that the low-level
module registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer
to take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it can
lead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the bridge if
the parent device does not have a driver.

To address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_bridge
struct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the function for
registering a bridge to take an additional owner module parameter and
rename it to avoid conflicts. Use the old function name for a helper macro
that automatically sets the module that registers the bridge as the owner.
This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules and
reduces the chances of registering a bridge without setting the owner.

Also, update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface
for registering an fpga bridge.

Other changes: opportunistically move put_device() from __fpga_bridge_get()
to fpga_bridge_get() and of_fpga_bridge_get() to improve code clarity since
the bridge device is taken in these functions."	hot

gpiolib: cdev: Fix use after free in lineinfo_changed_notify

The use-after-free issue occurs as follows: when the GPIO chip device file
is being closed by invoking gpio_chrdev_release(), watched_lines is freed
by bitmap_free(), but the unregistration of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier
chain failed due to waiting write rwsem. Additionally, one of the GPIO
chip's lines is also in the release process and holds the notifier chain's
read rwsem. Consequently, a race condition leads to the use-after-free of
watched_lines.

Here is the typical stack when issue happened:

[free]
gpio_chrdev_release()
  --> bitmap_free(cdev->watched_lines)                  <-- freed
  --> blocking_notifier_chain_unregister()
    --> down_write(&nh->rwsem)                          <-- waiting rwsem
          --> __down_write_common()
            --> rwsem_down_write_slowpath()
                  --> schedule_preempt_disabled()
                    --> schedule()

[use]
st54spi_gpio_dev_release()
  --> gpio_free()
    --> gpiod_free()
      --> gpiod_free_commit()
        --> gpiod_line_state_notify()
          --> blocking_notifier_call_chain()
            --> down_read(&nh->rwsem);                  <-- held rwsem
            --> notifier_call_chain()
              --> lineinfo_changed_notify()
                --> test_bit(xxxx, cdev->watched_lines) <-- use after free

The side effect of the use-after-free issue is that a GPIO line event is
being generated for userspace where it shouldn't. However, since the chrdev
is being closed, userspace won't have the chance to read that event anyway.

To fix the issue, call the bitmap_free() function after the unregistration
of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier chain."	hot

The splat occurs because skb->data points past skb->head allocated area.
This is because neigh layer does:
  __skb_pull(skb, skb_network_offset(skb));

... but skb_network_offset() returns a negative offset and __skb_pull()
arg is unsigned.  IOW, we skb->data gets ""adjusted"" by a huge value.

The negative value is returned because skb->head and skb->data distance is
more than 64k and skb->network_header (u16) has wrapped around.

The bug is in the ip_tunnel infrastructure, which can cause
dev->needed_headroom to increment ad infinitum.

The syzkaller reproducer consists of packets getting routed via a gre
tunnel, and route of gre encapsulated packets pointing at another (ipip)
tunnel.  The ipip encapsulation finds gre0 as next output device.

This results in the following pattern:

1). First packet is to be sent out via gre0.
Route lookup found an output device, ipip0.

2).
ip_tunnel_xmit for gre0 bumps gre0->needed_headroom based on the future
output device, rt.dev->needed_headroom (ipip0).

3).
ip output / start_xmit moves skb on to ipip0. which runs the same
code path again (xmit recursion).

4).
Routing step for the post-gre0-encap packet finds gre0 as output device
to use for ipip0 encapsulated packet.

tunl0->needed_headroom is then incremented based on the (already bumped)
gre0 device headroom.

This repeats for every future packet:

gre0->needed_headroom gets inflated because previous packets' ipip0 step
incremented rt->dev (gre0) headroom, and ipip0 incremented because gre0
needed_headroom was increased.

For each subsequent packet, gre/ipip0->needed_headroom grows until
post-expand-head reallocations result in a skb->head/data distance of
more than 64k.

Once that happens, skb->network_header (u16) wraps around when
pskb_expand_head tries to make sure that skb_network_offset() is unchanged
after the headroom expansion/reallocation.

After this skb_network_offset(skb) returns a different (and negative)
result post headroom expansion.

The next trip to neigh layer (or anything else that would __skb_pull the
network header) makes skb->data point to a memory location outside
skb->head area.

v2: Cap the needed_headroom update to an arbitarily chosen upperlimit to
prevent perpetual increase instead of dropping the headroom increment

CVE-2024-26812	Linux	Linux	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfio/pci: Create persistent INTx handler

A vulnerability exists where the eventfd for INTx signaling can be
deconfigured, which unregisters the IRQ handler but still allows
eventfds to be signaled with a NULL context through the SET_IRQS ioctl
or through unmask irqfd if the device interrupt is pending.

Ideally this could be solved with some additional locking; the igate
mutex serializes the ioctl and config space accesses, and the interrupt
handler is unregistered relative to the trigger, but the irqfd path
runs asynchronous to those.  The igate mutex cannot be acquired from the
atomic context of the eventfd wake function.  Disabling the irqfd
relative to the eventfd registration is potentially incompatible with
existing userspace.

As a result, the solution implemented here moves configuration of the
INTx interrupt handler to track the lifetime of the INTx context object
and irq_type configuration, rather than registration of a particular
trigger eventfd.  Synchronization is added between the ioctl path and
eventfd_signal() wrapper such that the eventfd trigger can be
dynamically updated relative to in-flight interrupts or irqfd callbacks."	hot

x86/efistub: Use 1:1 file:memory mapping for PE/COFF .compat section

The .compat section is a dummy PE section that contains the address of
the 32-bit entrypoint of the 64-bit kernel image if it is bootable from
32-bit firmware (i.e., CONFIG_EFI_MIXED=y)

This section is only 8 bytes in size and is only referenced from the
loader, and so it is placed at the end of the memory view of the image,
to avoid the need for padding it to 4k, which is required for sections
appearing in the middle of the image.

Unfortunately, this violates the PE/COFF spec, and even if most EFI
loaders will work correctly (including the Tianocore reference
implementation), PE loaders do exist that reject such images, on the
basis that both the file and memory views of the file contents should be
described by the section headers in a monotonically increasing manner
without leaving any gaps.

So reorganize the sections to avoid this issue. This results in a slight
padding overhead (< 4k) which can be avoided if desired by disabling

For this reason, the associated plain NEON glue code will copy inputs
shorter than 16 bytes into a temporary buffer, given that this is a rare

aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts

This patch is against CVE-2023-6270. The description of cve is:

  A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux
  kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on
  `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing
  between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq`
  global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or
  potential code execution.

In aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial
code is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in
later tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the
dev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb
initial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into
use-after-free because the net_device is freed.

This patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in
aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), and added dev_put() after skb xmit in tx()."	hot

USB: core: Fix deadlock in port ""disable"" sysfs attribute

The show and store callback routines for the ""disable"" sysfs attribute
file in port.c acquire the device lock for the port's parent hub
device.  This can cause problems if another process has locked the hub
to remove it or change its configuration:

	Removing the hub or changing its configuration requires the
	hub interface to be removed, which requires the port device
	to be removed, and device_del() waits until all outstanding
	sysfs attribute callbacks for the ports have returned.  The
	lock can't be released until then.

	But the disable_show() or disable_store() routine can't return
	until after it has acquired the lock.

The resulting deadlock can be avoided by calling
sysfs_break_active_protection().  This will cause the sysfs core not
to wait for the attribute's callback routine to return, allowing the
removal to proceed.  The disadvantage is that after making this call,
there is no guarantee that the hub structure won't be deallocated at
any moment.  To prevent this, we have to acquire a reference to it
first by calling hub_get()."	hot

soc: qcom: pmic_glink_altmode: fix drm bridge use-after-free

A recent DRM series purporting to simplify support for ""transparent
bridges"" and handling of probe deferrals ironically exposed a
use-after-free issue on pmic_glink_altmode probe deferral.

This has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failing
to initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines like
the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.

Specifically, the dp-hpd bridge is currently registered before all
resources have been acquired which means that it can also be
deregistered on probe deferrals.

In the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver
(or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge and
stored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about to
be deallocated.

When the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a
use-after-free when attaching the bridges:

	dp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)

which may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:

	[drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16

or a NULL-pointer dereference:

	Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000
	...
	Call trace:
	  drm_bridge_attach+0x70/0x1a8 [drm]
	  drm_aux_bridge_attach+0x24/0x38 [aux_bridge]

	  dp_bridge_init+0xa8/0x15c [msm]
	  msm_dp_modeset_init+0x28/0xc4 [msm]

The DRM bridge implementation is clearly fragile and implicitly built on
the assumption that bridges may never go away. In this case, the fix is
to move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to
after all resources have been looked up.

Incidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers
child devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue
in driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see
commit fbc35b45f9f6 (""Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER"")).

PCI: Fix active state requirement in PME polling

The commit noted in fixes added a bogus requirement that runtime PM managed
devices need to be in the RPM_ACTIVE state for PME polling.  In fact, only
devices in low power states should be polled.

However there's still a requirement that the device config space must be
accessible, which has implications for both the current state of the polled
device and the parent bridge, when present.  It's not sufficient to assume
the bridge remains in D0 and cases have been observed where the bridge
passes the D0 test, but the PM state indicates RPM_SUSPENDING and config
space of the polled device becomes inaccessible during pci_pme_wakeup().

Therefore, since the bridge is already effectively required to be in the
RPM_ACTIVE state, formalize this in the code and elevate the PM usage count
to maintain the state while polling the subordinate device.

This resolves a regression reported in the bugzilla below where a
Thunderbolt/USB4 hierarchy fails to scan for an attached NVMe endpoint

USB: core: Fix deadlock in usb_deauthorize_interface()

Among the attribute file callback routines in
drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c, the interface_authorized_store() function is
the only one which acquires a device lock on an ancestor device: It
calls usb_deauthorize_interface(), which locks the interface's parent
USB device.

The will lead to deadlock if another process already owns that lock
and tries to remove the interface, whether through a configuration
change or because the device has been disconnected.  As part of the
removal procedure, device_del() waits for all ongoing sysfs attribute
callbacks to complete.  But usb_deauthorize_interface() can't complete
until the device lock has been released, and the lock won't be
released until the removal has finished.

The mechanism provided by sysfs to prevent this kind of deadlock is
to use the sysfs_break_active_protection() function, which tells sysfs
not to wait for the attribute callback.

crypto: qat - resolve race condition during AER recovery

During the PCI AER system's error recovery process, the kernel driver
may encounter a race condition with freeing the reset_data structure's
memory. If the device restart will take more than 10 seconds the function
scheduling that restart will exit due to a timeout, and the reset_data
structure will be freed. However, this data structure is used for
completion notification after the restart is completed, which leads
to a UAF bug.

This results in a KFENCE bug notice.

  BUG: KFENCE: use-after-free read in adf_device_reset_worker+0x38/0xa0 [intel_qat]
  Use-after-free read at 0x00000000bc56fddf (in kfence-#142):
  adf_device_reset_worker+0x38/0xa0 [intel_qat]
  process_one_work+0x173/0x340

To resolve this race condition, the memory associated to the container
of the work_struct is freed on the worker if the timeout expired,
otherwise on the function that schedules the worker.
The timeout detection can be done by checking if the caller is
still waiting for completion or not by using completion_done() function."	hot

Red Hat has made a claim that there is a security risk within Red Hat products. NLnet Labs has no further information about the claim, and suggests that affected Red Hat customers refer to available Red Hat documentation or support channels. ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION: A heap-buffer-overflow flaw was found in the cfg_mark_ports function within Unbound's config_file.c, which can lead to memory corruption. This issue could allow an attacker with local access to provide specially crafted input, potentially causing the application to crash or allowing arbitrary code execution.

The `_gcoap_forward_proxy_copy_options()` function does not implement an explicit size check before copying data to the `cep->req_etag` buffer that is `COAP_ETAG_LENGTH_MAX` bytes long. If an attacker can craft input so that `optlen` becomes larger than `COAP_ETAG_LENGTH_MAX`, they can cause a buffer overflow. If the input above is attacker-controlled and crosses a security boundary, the impact of the buffer overflow vulnerabilities could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution. This issue has yet to be patched. Users are advised to add manual bounds checking."	hot

CVE-2024-32984	libp2p	rust-yamux	"Yamux is a stream multiplexer over reliable, ordered connections such as TCP/IP. The Rust implementation of the Yamux stream multiplexer uses a vector for pending frames. This vector is not bounded in length. Every time the Yamux protocol requires sending of a new frame, this frame gets appended to this vector. This can be remotely triggered in a number of ways, for example by: 1. Opening a new libp2p Identify stream. This causes the node to send its Identify message. Of course, every other protocol that causes the sending of data also works. The larger the response, the more data is enqueued. 2. Sending a Yamux Ping frame. This causes a Pong frame to be enqueued. Under normal circumstances, this queue of pending frames would be drained once theyâ€™re sent out over the network. However, the attacker can use TCPâ€™s receive window mechanism to prevent the victim from sending out any data: By not reading from the TCP connection, the receive window will never be increased, and the victim wonâ€™t be able to send out any new data (this is how TCP implements backpressure). Once this happens, Yamuxâ€™s queue of pending frames will start growing indefinitely. The queue will only be drained once the underlying TCP connection is closed. An attacker can cause a remote node to run out of memory, which will result in the corresponding process getting terminated by the operating system.

In the commit aee2424246f9 (""RDMA/iwcm: Fix a use-after-free related to

work queue iwcm_wq.

But at that time, the work queue iwcm_wq was created via the function
alloc_ordered_workqueue without the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM.

Because the current process is trying to flush the whole iwcm_wq, if
iwcm_wq doesn't have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM, verify that the current
process is not reclaiming memory or running on a workqueue which doesn't
have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM as that can break forward-progress guarantee

This vulnerability relates to **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** in the `/queue/join` endpoint. Gradioâ€™s `async_save_url_to_cache` function allows attackers to force the Gradio server to send HTTP requests to user-controlled URLs. This could enable attackers to target internal servers or services within a local network and possibly exfiltrate data or cause unwanted internal requests. Additionally, the content from these URLs is stored locally, making it easier for attackers to upload potentially malicious files to the server. This impacts users deploying Gradio servers that use components like the Video component which involve URL fetching. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue.  As a workaround, users can disable or heavily restrict URL-based inputs in their Gradio applications to trusted domains only. Additionally, implementing stricter URL validation (such as allowinglist-based validation) and ensuring that local or internal network addresses cannot be requested via the `/queue/join` endpoint can help mitigate the risk of SSRF attacks."	hot

When submitting more than 2^32 padata objects to padata_do_serial, the
current sorting implementation incorrectly sorts padata objects with
overflowed seq_nr, causing them to be placed before existing objects in
the reorder list. This leads to a deadlock in the serialization process
as padata_find_next cannot match padata->seq_nr and pd->processed
because the padata instance with overflowed seq_nr will be selected
next.

To fix this, we use an unsigned integer wrap around to correctly sort
padata objects in scenarios with integer overflow."	hot

This 32-bit negative value is then cast to a 64-bit unsigned integer (0xfffffffffffffffa) in a subsequent call to gst_buffer_new_and_alloc.

A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped.

Downstream users of RSSHub are not vulnerable to this issue, and commit 64e00e7 fixed the underlying issue and made the repository no longer vulnerable. The `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow gets triggered when the `PR - Docker build test` workflow completes successfully. It then collects some information about the Pull Request that triggered the triggering workflow and set some labels depending on the PR body and sender. If the PR also contains a `routes` markdown block, it will set the `TEST_CONTINUE` environment variable to `true`. The workflow then downloads and extracts an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow which is expected to contain a single `rsshub.tar.zst` file. However, prior to commit 64e00e7, it did not validate and the contents were extracted in the root of the workspace overriding any existing files. Since the contents of the artifact were not validated, it is possible for a malicious actor to send a Pull Request which uploads, not just the `rsshub.tar.zst` compressed docker image, but also a malicious `package.json` file with a script to run arbitrary code in the context of the privileged workflow.

CVE-2024-39554	Juniper Networks	Junos OS	"A Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability the 

Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd)

 of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to inject incremental routing updates when BGP multipath is enabled, causing rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Since this is a timing issue (race condition), the successful exploitation of this vulnerability is outside the attacker's control.Â  However, continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update.Â  Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.

This issue only affects systems with BGP multipath enabled.

functions being called:

bonding_exit()

oops, although it was much less likely to be triggered unintentionally:

CPU1
  rmmod bonding
    bonding_exit()
      bond_destroy_debugfs()
        debugfs_remove_recursive(bonding_debug_root);

CPU2
  echo -bond0 > /sys/class/net/bonding_masters
    bond_uninit()
      bond_debug_unregister()
        if (!bonding_debug_root)

CPU1
        bonding_debug_root = NULL;

So do NOT revert the bad commit (since the removed checks were racy
anyway), and instead change the order of actions taken during module
removal.  The same oops can also happen if there is an error during
module init, so apply the same fix there."	hot

CVE-2024-29186	brefphp	bref	"Bref is an open-source project that helps users go serverless on Amazon Web Services with PHP. When Bref prior to version 2.1.17 is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed. In the parsing process, the `Content-Type` header of each part is read using the `Riverline/multipart-parser` library.

The library, in the `StreamedPart::parseHeaderContent` function, performs slow multi-byte string operations on the header value.
Precisely, the `mb_convert_encoding` function is used with the first (`$string`) and third (`$from_encoding`) parameters read from the header value.

An attacker could send specifically crafted requests which would force the server into performing long operations with a consequent long billed duration.

The attack has the following requirements and limitations: The Lambda should use the Event-Driven Function runtime and the `RequestHandlerInterface` handler and should implement at least an endpoint accepting POST requests; the attacker can send requests up to 6MB long (this is enough to cause a billed duration between 400ms and 500ms with the default 1024MB RAM Lambda image of Bref); and if the Lambda uses a PHP runtime <= php-82, the impact is higher as the billed duration in the default 1024MB RAM Lambda image of Bref could be brought to more than 900ms for each request. Notice that the vulnerability applies only to headers read from the request body as the request header has a limitation which allows a total maximum size of ~10KB.

Version 2.1.17 contains a fix for this issue."	hot

CVE-2024-29902	sigstore	cosign	"Cosign provides code signing and transparency for containers and binaries. Prior to version 2.2.4, a remote image with a malicious attachment can cause denial of service of the host machine running Cosign. This can impact other services on the machine that rely on having memory available such as a Redis database which can result in data loss. It can also impact the availability of other services on the machine that will not be available for the duration of the machine denial. The root cause of this issue is that Cosign reads the attachment from a remote image entirely into memory without checking the size of the attachment first. As such, a large attachment can make Cosign read a large attachment into memory; If the attachments size is larger than the machine has memory available, the machine will be denied of service. The Go runtime will make a SigKill after a few seconds of system-wide denial. This issue can allow a supply-chain escalation from a compromised registry to the Cosign user: If an attacher has compromised a registry or the account of an image vendor, they can include a malicious attachment and hurt the image consumer.

CVE-2024-29018	moby	moby	"Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. Moby's networking implementation allows for many networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.

When containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.

Containers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.

In addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.

When a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.

As a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to an internal network will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.

Many systems run a local forwarding DNS resolver. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device. To bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` detects this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host namework namespace. The loopback resolver then forwards the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.

Because `dockerd` forwards DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, internal networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver. By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers.

Background info:

Log in to Streampark using the default username (e.g. test1, test2, test3) and the default password (streampark). Navigate to the Project module, then add a new project. Enter the git repository address of the project and input `touch /tmp/success_2.1.2` as the ""Build Argument"". Note that there is no verification and interception of the special character ""`"".

CVE-2024-49974	Linux	Linux	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: Limit the number of concurrent async COPY operations

Nothing appears to limit the number of concurrent async COPY
operations that clients can start. In addition, AFAICT each async
COPY can copy an unlimited number of 4MB chunks, so can run for a
long time. Thus IMO async COPY can become a DoS vector.

Add a restriction mechanism that bounds the number of concurrent
background COPY operations. Start simple and try to be fair -- this
patch implements a per-namespace limit.

An async COPY request that occurs while this limit is exceeded gets
NFS4ERR_DELAY. The requesting client can choose to send the request
again after a delay or fall back to a traditional read/write style
copy.

If there is need to make the mechanism more sophisticated, we can
visit that in future patches."	hot

That's a pointless panic which is a leftover of the historic IO/APIC code

The only place which might justify panic is the PIT/HPET timer_check() code
which tries to figure out whether the timer interrupt is delivered through
the IO/APIC. But that code does not require to handle interrupt allocation
failures. If the interrupt cannot be allocated then timer delivery fails
and it either panics due to that or falls back to legacy mode.

Cure this by removing the panic wrapper around __add_pin_to_irq_node() and
making mp_irqdomain_alloc() aware of the failure condition and handle it as
any other failure in this function gracefully."	hot

The TPM event log table is a Linux specific construct, where the data
produced by the GetEventLog() boot service is cached in memory, and
passed on to the OS using an EFI configuration table.

The use of EFI_LOADER_DATA here results in the region being left
unreserved in the E820 memory map constructed by the EFI stub, and this
is the memory description that is passed on to the incoming kernel by
kexec, which is therefore unaware that the region should be reserved.

Even though the utility of the TPM2 event log after a kexec is
questionable, any corruption might send the parsing code off into the
weeds and crash the kernel. So let's use EFI_ACPI_RECLAIM_MEMORY

of sungem driver, however, disable_irq() might sleep. After analyzing
the implementation of fec_poll_controller(), the fec driver should have
the same issue. Due to the fec driver uses NAPI for TX completions, the

drm/mediatek: Init `ddp_comp` with devm_kcalloc()

In the case where `conn_routes` is true we allocate an extra slot in
the `ddp_comp` array but mtk_drm_crtc_create() never seemed to
initialize it in the test case I ran. For me, this caused a later
crash when we looped through the array in mtk_drm_crtc_mode_valid().
This showed up for me when I booted with `slub_debug=FZPUA` which
poisons the memory initially. Without `slub_debug` I couldn't
reproduce, presumably because the later code handles the value being
NULL and in most cases (not guaranteed in all cases) the memory the
allocator returned started out as 0.

It really doesn't hurt to initialize the array with devm_kcalloc()
since the array is small and the overhead of initting a handful of
elements to 0 is small. In general initting memory to zero is a safer
practice and usually it's suggested to only use the non-initting alloc
functions if you really need to.

Let's switch the function to use an allocation function that zeros the
memory. For me, this avoids the crash."	hot

The application does not account for symlinks placed inside the sandbox directory, which can be leveraged by an attacker to write to arbitrary files and gain code execution outside of the sandbox. When executing a submission, Judge0 writes a `run_script` to the sandbox directory. The security issue is that an attacker can create a symbolic link (symlink) at the path `run_script` before this code is executed, resulting in the `f.write` writing to an arbitrary file on the unsandboxed system. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to overwrite scripts on the system and gain code execution outside of the sandbox.

The `JwtFilter` handles the API authentication by requiring and verifying JWT tokens. When a new request comes in, the request's path is checked against this list. When the request's path contains any of the excluded endpoints the filter returns without validating the JWT. Unfortunately, an attacker may use Path Parameters to make any path contain any arbitrary strings. For example, a request to `GET /api/v1;v1%2fusers%2flogin/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/111` will match the excluded endpoint condition and therefore will be processed with no JWT validation allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and reach any arbitrary endpoint, including the ones listed above that lead to arbitrary SpEL expression injection. This bypass will not work when the endpoint uses the `SecurityContext.getUserPrincipal()` since it will return `null` and will throw an NPE. This issue may lead to authentication bypass and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

KaTeX users who render untrusted mathematical expressions could encounter malicious input using `\def` or `\newcommand` that causes a near-infinite loop, despite setting `maxExpand` to avoid such loops. KaTeX supports an option named maxExpand which aims to prevent infinitely recursive macros from consuming all available memory and/or triggering a stack overflow error. Unfortunately, support for ""Unicode (sub|super)script characters"" allows an attacker to bypass this limit. Each sub/superscript group instantiated a separate Parser with its own limit on macro executions, without inheriting the current count of macro executions from its parent. This has been corrected in KaTeX v0.16.10."	hot
