CVE-2024-1873	parisneo	parisneo/lollms-webui	"parisneo/lollms-webui is vulnerable to path traversal and denial of service attacks due to an exposed `/select_database` endpoint in version a9d16b0. The endpoint improperly handles file paths, allowing attackers to specify absolute paths when interacting with the `DiscussionsDB` instance. This flaw enables attackers to create directories anywhere on the system where the application has permissions, potentially leading to denial of service by creating directories with names of critical files, such as HTTPS certificate files, causing server startup failures. Additionally, attackers can manipulate the database path, resulting in the loss of client data by constantly changing the file location to an attacker-controlled location, scattering the data across the filesystem and making recovery difficult."
CVE-2024-1879	significant-gravitas	significant-gravitas/autogpt	"A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in significant-gravitas/autogpt version v0.5.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the AutoGPT server. The vulnerability stems from the lack of protections on the API endpoint receiving instructions, enabling an attacker to direct a user running AutoGPT in their local network to a malicious website. This site can then send crafted requests to the AutoGPT server, leading to command execution. The issue is exacerbated by CORS being enabled for arbitrary origins by default, allowing the attacker to read the response of all cross-site queries. This vulnerability was addressed in version 5.1."
CVE-2024-1880	significant-gravitas	significant-gravitas/autogpt	"An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the MacOS Text-To-Speech class MacOSTTS of the significant-gravitas/autogpt project, affecting versions up to v0.5.0. The vulnerability arises from the improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command within the `_speech` method of the MacOSTTS class. Specifically, the use of `os.system` to execute the `say` command with user-supplied text allows for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can inject shell commands. This issue is triggered when the AutoGPT instance is run with the `--speak` option enabled and configured with `TEXT_TO_SPEECH_PROVIDER=macos`, reflecting back a shell injection snippet. The impact of this vulnerability is the potential execution of arbitrary code on the instance running AutoGPT. The issue was addressed in version 5.1.0."
CVE-2024-1881	significant-gravitas	significant-gravitas/autogpt	"AutoGPT, a component of significant-gravitas/autogpt, is vulnerable to an improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('OS Command Injection') due to a flaw in its shell command validation function. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in versions v0.5.0 up to but not including 5.1.0. The issue arises from the application's method of validating shell commands against an allowlist or denylist, where it only checks the first word of the command. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended restrictions by crafting commands that are executed despite not being on the allowlist or by including malicious commands not present in the denylist. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands."
CVE-2024-1892	scrapy	scrapy/scrapy	"A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the XMLFeedSpider class of the scrapy/scrapy project, specifically in the parsing of XML content.

CVE-2024-26800	Linux	Linux	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tls: fix use-after-free on failed backlog decryption

When the decrypt request goes to the backlog and crypto_aead_decrypt
returns -EBUSY, tls_do_decryption will wait until all async
decryptions have completed. If one of them fails, tls_do_decryption
will return -EBADMSG and tls_decrypt_sg jumps to the error path,
releasing all the pages. But the pages have been passed to the async
callback, and have already been released by tls_decrypt_done.

The only true async case is when crypto_aead_decrypt returns
 -EINPROGRESS. With -EBUSY, we already waited so we can tell
tls_sw_recvmsg that the data is available for immediate copy, but we
need to notify tls_decrypt_sg (via the new ->async_done flag) that the
memory has already been released."

aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts

This patch is against CVE-2023-6270. The description of cve is:

  A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux
  kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on
  `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing
  between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq`
  global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or
  potential code execution.

In aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial
code is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in
later tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the
dev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb
initial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into
use-after-free because the net_device is freed.

This patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in
aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), and added dev_put() after skb xmit in tx()."

This is because we're completing the nfs_direct_request twice in a row.

The source of this is when we have our commit requests to submit, we
process them and send them off, and then in the completion path for the
commit requests we have

if (nfs_commit_end(cinfo.mds))
	nfs_direct_write_complete(dreq);

However since we're submitting asynchronous requests we sometimes have
one that completes before we submit the next one, so we end up calling
complete on the nfs_direct_request twice.

The only other place we use nfs_generic_commit_list() is in
__nfs_commit_inode, which wraps this call in a

nfs_commit_begin();
nfs_commit_end();

Which is a common pattern for this style of completion handling, one
that is also repeated in the direct code with get_dreq()/put_dreq()
calls around where we process events as well as in the completion paths.

Fix this by using the same pattern for the commit requests.

crypto: qat - resolve race condition during AER recovery

During the PCI AER system's error recovery process, the kernel driver
may encounter a race condition with freeing the reset_data structure's
memory. If the device restart will take more than 10 seconds the function
scheduling that restart will exit due to a timeout, and the reset_data
structure will be freed. However, this data structure is used for
completion notification after the restart is completed, which leads
to a UAF bug.

This results in a KFENCE bug notice.

In version 1.39.0, use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors, allowing standard input to be re-opened as a different resource resulting in permission prompt bypass. Node child_process IPC relies on the JS side to pass the raw IPC file descriptor to `op_node_ipc_pipe()`, which returns a `IpcJsonStreamResource` ID associated with the file descriptor. On closing the resource, the raw file descriptor is closed together.

Use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors. This allow standard input (fd 0) to be closed and re-opened for a different resource, which allows a silent permission prompt bypass.

As such, the untrusted artifact can control the amount of memory that Cosign allocates. The exact issue is Cosign allocates excessive memory on the lines that creates a slice of the same length as the manifests. Version 2.2.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability."

CVE-2024-3183	Red Hat	Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7	"A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in a way when a Kerberos TGS-REQ is encrypted using the client’s session key. This key is different for each new session, which protects it from brute force attacks. However, the ticket it contains is encrypted using the target principal key directly. For user principals, this key is a hash of a public per-principal randomly-generated salt and the user’s password.

If a principal is compromised it means the attacker would be able to retrieve tickets encrypted to any principal, all of them being encrypted by their own key directly. By taking these tickets and salts offline, the attacker could run brute force attacks to find character strings able to decrypt tickets when combined to a principal salt (i.e. find the principal’s password)."

CVE-2024-35847	Linux	Linux	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

irqchip/gic-v3-its: Prevent double free on error

The error handling path in its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc() causes a double free
when its_vpe_init() fails after successfully allocating at least one
interrupt. This happens because its_vpe_irq_domain_free() frees the
interrupts along with the area bitmap and the vprop_page and
its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc() subsequently frees the area bitmap and the
vprop_page again.

Fix this by unconditionally invoking its_vpe_irq_domain_free() which
handles all cases correctly and by removing the bitmap/vprop_page freeing
from its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc().

CVE-2024-36899	Linux	Linux	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpiolib: cdev: Fix use after free in lineinfo_changed_notify

The use-after-free issue occurs as follows: when the GPIO chip device file
is being closed by invoking gpio_chrdev_release(), watched_lines is freed
by bitmap_free(), but the unregistration of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier
chain failed due to waiting write rwsem. Additionally, one of the GPIO
chip's lines is also in the release process and holds the notifier chain's
read rwsem. Consequently, a race condition leads to the use-after-free of
watched_lines.

Here is the typical stack when issue happened:

[free]
gpio_chrdev_release()
  --> bitmap_free(cdev->watched_lines)                  <-- freed
  --> blocking_notifier_chain_unregister()
    --> down_write(&nh->rwsem)                          <-- waiting rwsem
          --> __down_write_common()
            --> rwsem_down_write_slowpath()
                  --> schedule_preempt_disabled()
                    --> schedule()

[use]
st54spi_gpio_dev_release()
  --> gpio_free()
    --> gpiod_free()
      --> gpiod_free_commit()
        --> gpiod_line_state_notify()
          --> blocking_notifier_call_chain()
            --> down_read(&nh->rwsem);                  <-- held rwsem
            --> notifier_call_chain()
              --> lineinfo_changed_notify()
                --> test_bit(xxxx, cdev->watched_lines) <-- use after free

The side effect of the use-after-free issue is that a GPIO line event is
being generated for userspace where it shouldn't. However, since the chrdev
is being closed, userspace won't have the chance to read that event anyway.

To fix the issue, call the bitmap_free() function after the unregistration
of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier chain."

CVE-2024-38346	Apache Software Foundation	Apache CloudStack	"The CloudStack cluster service runs on unauthenticated port (default 9090) that can be misused to run arbitrary commands on targeted hypervisors and CloudStack management server hosts. Some of these commands were found to have command injection vulnerabilities that can result in arbitrary code execution via agents on the hosts that may run as a privileged user. An attacker that can reach the cluster service on the unauthenticated port (default 9090), can exploit this to perform remote code execution on CloudStack managed hosts and result in complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CloudStack managed infrastructure.

Users are recommended to restrict the network access to the cluster service port (default 9090) on a CloudStack management server host to only its peer CloudStack management server hosts. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.2.1, 4.19.0.2 or later, which addresses this issue.

CVE-2024-39345			"AdTran 834-5 HDC17600021F1 (SmartOS 11.1.1.1) devices enable the SSH service by default and have a hidden, undocumented, hard-coded support account whose password is based on the devices MAC address. All of the devices internet interfaces share a similar MAC address that only varies in their final octet. This allows network-adjacent attackers to derive the support user's SSH password by decrementing the final octet of the connected gateway address or via the BSSID. An attacker can then execute arbitrary OS commands with root-level privileges. NOTE: The vendor states that there is no intended functionality allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary OS Commands with root-level privileges. The vendor also states that this issue was fixed in SmartOS 12.5.5.1."

Due to an improper initialisation logic, the integration API service would listen on a random port when its port value is set to 0 (default value). An attacker that can access the CloudStack management network could scan and find the randomised integration API service port and exploit it to perform unauthorised administrative actions and perform remote code execution on CloudStack managed hosts and result in complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CloudStack managed infrastructure.

Users are recommended to restrict the network access on the CloudStack management server hosts to only essential ports. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.2.1, 4.19.0.2 or later, which addresses this issue.

filelock: Remove locks reliably when fcntl/close race is detected

When fcntl_setlk() races with close(), it removes the created lock with
do_lock_file_wait().
However, LSMs can allow the first do_lock_file_wait() that created the lock
while denying the second do_lock_file_wait() that tries to remove the lock.
Separately, posix_lock_file() could also fail to
remove a lock due to GFP_KERNEL allocation failure (when splitting a range
in the middle).

After the bug has been triggered, use-after-free reads will occur in
lock_get_status() when userspace reads /proc/locks. This can likely be used
to read arbitrary kernel memory, but can't corrupt kernel memory.

Fix it by calling locks_remove_posix() instead, which is designed to
reliably get rid of POSIX locks associated with the given file and

An OS Command Injection vulnerability allows any authenticated user on the application to execute arbitrary code on the web application server via port scanning functionality. User-supplied input is used without validation when constructing and executing an OS command. User supplied JSON POST data is parsed and if ""id"" JSON key does not exist, JSON value supplied via ""ip"" JSON key is assigned to the ""ip"" variable. Later on, ""ip"" variable which can be controlled by the attacker is used when constructing the cmd and cmd1 strings without any extra validation. Then, server_mod.subprocess_execute function is called on both cmd1 and cmd2. When the definition of the server_mod.subprocess_execute() function is analyzed, it can be seen that subprocess.Popen() is called on the input parameter with shell=True which results in OS Command Injection.

Extent Space Efficient (ESE) or thin provisioned volumes need to be
formatted on demand during usual IO processing.

The dasd_ese_needs_format function checks for error codes that signal
the non existence of a proper track format.

The check for incorrect length is to imprecise since other error cases
leading to transport of insufficient data also have this flag set.
This might lead to data corruption in certain error cases for example
during a storage server warmstart.

Fix by removing the check for incorrect length and replacing by
explicitly checking for invalid track format in transport mode.

Also remove the check for file protected since this is not a valid
ESE handling case."

CVE-2024-47606	gstreamer	gstreamer	"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An integer underflow has been detected in the function qtdemux_parse_theora_extension within qtdemux.c. The vulnerability occurs due to an underflow of the gint size variable, which causes size to hold a large unintended value when cast to an unsigned integer. This 32-bit negative value is then cast to a 64-bit unsigned integer (0xfffffffffffffffa) in a subsequent call to gst_buffer_new_and_alloc. The function gst_buffer_new_allocate then attempts to allocate memory, eventually calling _sysmem_new_block. The function _sysmem_new_block adds alignment and header size to the (unsigned) size, causing the overflow of the 'slice_size' variable. As a result, only 0x89 bytes are allocated, despite the large input size. When the following memcpy call occurs in gst_buffer_fill, the data from the input file will overwrite the content of the GstMapInfo info structure. Finally, during the call to gst_memory_unmap, the overwritten memory may cause a function pointer hijack, as the mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full function is called with a corrupted pointer. This function pointer overwrite could allow an attacker to alter the execution flow of the program, leading to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10."

In the commit aee2424246f9 (""RDMA/iwcm: Fix a use-after-free related to
destroying CM IDs""), the function flush_workqueue is invoked to flush the
work queue iwcm_wq.

But at that time, the work queue iwcm_wq was created via the function
alloc_ordered_workqueue without the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM.

Because the current process is trying to flush the whole iwcm_wq, if
iwcm_wq doesn't have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM, verify that the current
process is not reclaiming memory or running on a workqueue which doesn't
have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM as that can break forward-progress guarantee
leading to a deadlock.

CVE-2024-47879	OpenRefine	OpenRefine	"OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version 3.8.3, lack of cross-site request forgery protection on the `preview-expression` command means that visiting a malicious website could cause an attacker-controlled expression to be executed. The expression can contain arbitrary Clojure or Python code. The attacker must know a valid project ID of a project that contains at least one row, and the attacker must convince the victim to open a malicious webpage. Version 3.8.3 fixes the issue."
CVE-2024-47883	OpenRefine	simile-butterfly	"The OpenRefine fork of the MIT Simile Butterfly server is a modular web application framework. The Butterfly framework uses the `java.net.URL` class to refer to (what are expected to be) local resource files, like images or templates. This works: ""opening a connection"" to these URLs opens the local file. However, prior to version 1.2.6, if a `file:/` URL is directly given where a relative path (resource name) is expected, this is also accepted in some code paths; the app then fetches the file, from a remote machine if indicated, and uses it as if it was a trusted part of the app's codebase. This leads to multiple weaknesses and potential weaknesses. An attacker that has network access to the application could use it to gain access to files, either on the the server's filesystem (path traversal) or shared by nearby machines (server-side request forgery with e.g. SMB). An attacker that can lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL belonging to the app could cause arbitrary attacker-controlled JavaScript to be loaded in the victim's browser (cross-site scripting). If an app is written in such a way that an attacker can influence the resource name used for a template, that attacker could cause the app to fetch and execute an attacker-controlled template (remote code execution). Version 1.2.6 contains a patch."

""new_cam"" can be as high as 255 while the size of the uc->updated[] array
is UCSI_MAX_ALTMODES (30).

The call tree is:
ucsi_cmd() // val comes from simple_attr_write_xsigned()
-> ucsi_send_command()
   -> ucsi_send_command_common()
      -> ucsi_run_command() // calls ucsi->ops->sync_control()
         -> ucsi_ccg_sync_control()"
CVE-2024-50274	Linux	Linux	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

idpf: avoid vport access in idpf_get_link_ksettings

When the device control plane is removed or the platform
running device control plane is rebooted, a reset is detected
on the driver. On driver reset, it releases the resources and
waits for the reset to complete. If the reset fails, it takes
the error path and releases the vport lock. At this time if the
monitoring tools tries to access link settings, it call traces
for accessing released vport pointer.

To avoid it, move link_speed_mbps to netdev_priv structure
which removes the dependency on vport pointer and the vport lock
in idpf_get_link_ksettings. Also use netif_carrier_ok()
to check the link status and adjust the offsetof to use link_up
instead of link_speed_mbps."

CVE-2024-5277	lunary-ai	lunary-ai/lunary	"In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.4, a vulnerability exists in the password recovery mechanism where the reset password token is not invalidated after use. This allows an attacker who compromises the recovery token to repeatedly change the password of a victim's account. The issue lies in the backend's handling of the reset password process, where the token, once used, is not discarded or invalidated, enabling its reuse. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized account access if an attacker obtains the recovery token."

CVE-2024-53150	Linux	Linux	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix out of bounds reads when finding clock sources

The current USB-audio driver code doesn't check bLength of each
descriptor at traversing for clock descriptors.  That is, when a
device provides a bogus descriptor with a shorter bLength, the driver
might hit out-of-bounds reads.

For addressing it, this patch adds sanity checks to the validator
functions for the clock descriptor traversal.  When the descriptor
length is shorter than expected, it's skipped in the loop.

For the clock source and clock multiplier descriptors, we can just
check bLength against the sizeof() of each descriptor type.
OTOH, the clock selector descriptor of UAC2 and UAC3 has an array
of bNrInPins elements and two more fields at its tail, hence those
have to be checked in addition to the sizeof() check."

CVE-2024-53186	Linux	Linux	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix use-after-free in SMB request handling

A race condition exists between SMB request handling in
`ksmbd_conn_handler_loop()` and the freeing of `ksmbd_conn` in the
workqueue handler `handle_ksmbd_work()`. This leads to a UAF.
- KASAN: slab-use-after-free Read in handle_ksmbd_work
- KASAN: slab-use-after-free in rtlock_slowlock_locked

This race condition arises as follows:
- `ksmbd_conn_handler_loop()` waits for `conn->r_count` to reach zero:
  `wait_event(conn->r_count_q, atomic_read(&conn->r_count) == 0);`
- Meanwhile, `handle_ksmbd_work()` decrements `conn->r_count` using
  `atomic_dec_return(&conn->r_count)`, and if it reaches zero, calls
  `ksmbd_conn_free()`, which frees `conn`.
- However, after `handle_ksmbd_work()` decrements `conn->r_count`,
  it may still access `conn->r_count_q` in the following line:
  `waitqueue_active(&conn->r_count_q)` or `wake_up(&conn->r_count_q)`
  This results in a UAF, as `conn` has already been freed.

syzkaller's support for SMB requests."

CVE-2024-5452	lightning-ai	lightning-ai/pytorch-lightning	"A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the lightning-ai/pytorch-lightning library version 2.2.1 due to improper handling of deserialized user input and mismanagement of dunder attributes by the `deepdiff` library. The library uses `deepdiff.Delta` objects to modify application state based on frontend actions. However, it is possible to bypass the intended restrictions on modifying dunder attributes, allowing an attacker to construct a serialized delta that passes the deserializer whitelist and contains dunder attributes. When processed, this can be exploited to access other modules, classes, and instances, leading to arbitrary attribute write and total RCE on any self-hosted pytorch-lightning application in its default configuration, as the delta endpoint is enabled by default."

leaving garbage in res.replen:
- nfs3_read_done() copies that into server->read_hdrsize; from there
  nfs3_proc_read_setup() copies it to args.replen in new requests.
- nfs3_xdr_enc_read3args() passes that to rpc_prepare_reply_pages()

This is easily reproduced with NFSv3 LOCALIO that is servicing reads

CVE-2024-8508	NLnet Labs	Unbound	"NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long. This change should not affect normal DNS traffic."
