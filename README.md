## Intrusion Prediction

A repo for output of an experimental intrusion prediction project. Output is posted here where it is timestamped so that any correct predictions can be verified in linear time without creating a causality loop. At this time we are not contending any predestination paradoxes.

Contents:

2024: The first batch with CVEs for 2024 that came out of the model rated 'hot.' This set has not been through search space reduction yet but it will be soon. Predictions will be output here for 2025 CVEs at least monthly, maybe weekly, as the year goes on. A rating of 'hot' means the CVE will be on one or more watchlists due to exploitation and / or impaact. How is this being done? Probably not the way you think (no it is not being done by hand, it is an ML / AI project.)

Predictions so far:

Rated hot January 3, mentioned in VulnVerse Jan 5: (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/security-week-review-vulnverse-23-marko-%25C5%25BEivanovi%25C4%2587-4sstf/)
