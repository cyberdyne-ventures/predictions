## Intrusion Prediction

A repo for output of the experimental intrusion prediction project code named "dark fate." Output is posted here where it is timestamped so that any correct predictions can be verified in linear time without creating a causality loop. At this time we are not contending any predestination paradoxes.

The first batch contains 6328 of the 2024 CVEs because it has not been through search space reduction yet but it will be soon. Predictions will be output here for 2205 CVEs at least monthly, maybe weekly, as the year goes on.
