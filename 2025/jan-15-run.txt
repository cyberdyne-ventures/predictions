2	CVE-2025-21599	Juniper Networks	Junos OS Evolved	"A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Juniper Tunnel Driver (jtd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause Denial of Service. 

Receipt of specifically malformed IPv6 packets, destined to the device, causes kernel memory to not be freed, resulting in memory exhaustion leading to a system crash and Denial of Service (DoS). Continuous receipt and processing of these packets will continue to exhaust kernel memory, creating a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
This issue only affects systems configured with IPv6.

This issue affects Junos OS Evolved:

This issue requires a BGP session to be established.

This issue can propagate and multiply through multiple ASes until reaching vulnerable devices.

This issue affects iBGP and eBGP.

This issue affects IPv4 and IPv6.

An indicator of compromise may be the presence of malformed update messages in a neighboring AS which is unaffected by this issue:

For example, by issuing the command on the neighboring device:
 show log messages

Reviewing for similar messages from devices within proximity to each other may indicate this malformed packet is propagating:
  rpd[<pid>]: Received malformed update from <IP address> (External AS <AS#>)
and
  rpd[<pid>]: Malformed Attribute"	hot

181	CVE-2025-21607	vyperlang	vyper	"Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. When the Vyper Compiler uses the precompiles EcRecover (0x1) and Identity (0x4), the success flag of the call is not checked. As a consequence an attacker can provide a specific amount of gas to make these calls fail but let the overall execution continue. Then the execution result can be incorrect. Based on EVM's rules, after the failed precompile the remaining code has only 1/64 of the pre-call-gas left (as 63/64 were forwarded and spent). Hence, only fairly simple executions can follow the failed precompile calls. Therefore, we found no significantly impacted real-world contracts. None the less an advisory has been made out of an abundance of caution. There are no actions for users to take."	hot

638	CVE-2025-0412	Luxion	KeyShot Viewer	"Luxion KeyShot Viewer KSP File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Luxion KeyShot Viewer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the processing of KSP files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22139."	hot
