Receipt of specifically malformed IPv6 packets, destined to the device, causes kernel memory to not be freed, resulting in memory exhaustion leading to a system crash and Denial of Service (DoS). Continuous receipt and processing of these packets will continue to exhaust kernel memory, creating a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

net: reenable NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM offload for BIG TCP packets

The blamed commit disabled hardware offoad of IPv6 packets with
extension headers on devices that advertise NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM,
based on the definition of that feature in skbuff.h:

 *   * - %NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM
 *     - Driver (device) is only able to checksum plain
 *       TCP or UDP packets over IPv6. These are specifically
 *       unencapsulated packets of the form IPv6|TCP or
 *       IPv6|UDP where the Next Header field in the IPv6
 *       header is either TCP or UDP. IPv6 extension headers
 *       are not supported with this feature. This feature
 *       cannot be set in features for a device with
 *       NETIF_F_HW_CSUM also set. This feature is being
 *       DEPRECATED (see below).

The change causes skb_warn_bad_offload to fire for BIG TCP
packets.

BIG TCP introduced an IPV6_TLV_JUMBO IPv6 extension header to
communicate packet length, as this is an IPv6 jumbogram. But, the
feature is only enabled on devices that support BIG TCP TSO. The
header is only present for PF_PACKET taps like tcpdump, and not
transmitted by physical devices.

For this specific case of extension headers that are not
transmitted, return to the situation before the blamed commit
and support hardware offload.

ipv6_has_hopopt_jumbo() tests not only whether this header is present,
but also that it is the only extension header before a terminal (L4)
header."	cold

This issue can propagate and multiply through multiple ASes until reaching vulnerable devices.

This issue affects iBGP and eBGP.

This issue affects IPv4 and IPv6.

An indicator of compromise may be the presence of malformed update messages in a neighboring AS which is unaffected by this issue:

For example, by issuing the command on the neighboring device:
 show log messages

Reviewing for similar messages from devices within proximity to each other may indicate this malformed packet is propagating:

370	CVE-2025-22828	Apache Software Foundation	Apache CloudStack	"CloudStack users can add and read comments (annotations) on resources they are authorised to access. 

Due to an access validation issue that affects Apache CloudStack versions from 4.16.0, users who have access, prior access or knowledge of resource UUIDs can list and add comments (annotations) to such resources. 

An attacker with a user-account and access or prior knowledge of resource UUIDs may exploit this issue to read contents of the comments (annotations) or add malicious comments (annotations) to such resources. 

This may cause potential loss of confidentiality of CloudStack environments and resources if the comments (annotations) contain any privileged information. However, guessing or brute-forcing resource UUIDs are generally hard to impossible and access to listing or adding comments isn't same as access to CloudStack resources, making this issue of very low severity and general low impact.

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `dependente_parentesco_adicionar.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `descricao` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `dependente_parentesco_adicionar.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored on the server.

Importantly, these constraints are actually required to be true in DER, but that correctness wasn't enforced on the early node parser side so it was incorrect to rely on it later on in decoding, which is what the library did.

These crashes can be triggered when parsing any DER/BER format object. There is no memory-safety issue here: the crash is a graceful one from the Swift runtime.
