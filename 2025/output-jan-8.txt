CVE-2025-21623	MacWarrior	clipbucket-v5	"ClipBucket V5 provides open source video hosting with PHP. Prior to 5.5.1 - 238, ClipBucket V5 allows unauthenticated attackers to change the template directory via a directory traversal, which results in a denial of service."	hot
CVE-2025-20126	Cisco	Cisco ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent	"A vulnerability in certification validation routines of Cisco ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent for macOS and RoomOS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to intercept or manipulate metrics information.

This vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly validate certificates for hosted metrics services. An on-path attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting network traffic using a crafted certificate. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to masquerade as a trusted host and monitor or change communications between the remote metrics service and the vulnerable client."	hot
CVE-2025-20123	Cisco	Cisco Crosswork Network Change Automation	"Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Crosswork Network Controller could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against users of the interface of an affected system.

These vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by inserting malicious data into specific data fields in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.
Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities."	hot
CVE-2025-22136	Eugeny	tabby	"Tabby (formerly Terminus) is a highly configurable terminal emulator. Prior to 1.0.217 , Tabby enables several high-risk Electron Fuses, including RunAsNode, EnableNodeCliInspectArguments, and EnableNodeOptionsEnvironmentVariable. These fuses create potential code injection vectors even though the application is signed with hardened runtime and lacks dangerous entitlements such as com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation and com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.217."	hot

CVE-2025-22395	Dell	Dell Update Package (DUP) Framework	"Dell Update Package Framework, versions prior to 22.01.02, contain(s) a Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. A local low privileged attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the execution of arbitrary remote scripts on the server. Exploitation may lead to a denial of service by an attacker."	hot
CVE-2025-22140	nilsonLazarin	WeGIA	"WeGIA is a web manager for charitable institutions. A SQL Injection vulnerability was identified in the /html/funcionario/dependente_listar_um.php endpoint, specifically in the id_dependente parameter. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the database. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.8."	hot
CVE-2025-22215	VMware	VMware Aria Automation	"VMware Aria Automation contains a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. A malicious actor with ""Organization Member"" access to Aria Automation may exploit this vulnerability enumerate internal services running on the host/network."	hot
CVE-2025-22389			"An issue was discovered in Optimizely EPiServer.CMS.Core before 12.32.0. A medium-severity vulnerability exists in the CMS, where the application does not properly validate uploaded files. This allows the upload of potentially malicious file types, including .docm .html. When accessed by application users, these files can be used to execute malicious actions or compromise users' systems."	hot
