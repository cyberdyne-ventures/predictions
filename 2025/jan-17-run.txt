CVE-2025-21171	hot	Microsoft	.NET 9.0	.NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
CVE-2025-21599	hot	Juniper Networks	Junos OS Evolved	"A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Juniper Tunnel Driver (jtd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause Denial of Service. 

Receipt of specifically malformed IPv6 packets, destined to the device, causes kernel memory to not be freed, resulting in memory exhaustion leading to a system crash and Denial of Service (DoS). Continuous receipt and processing of these packets will continue to exhaust kernel memory, creating a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
This issue only affects systems configured with IPv6.

This issue affects Junos OS Evolved: 



  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S5-EVO, 
  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S2-EVO, 
  *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-S2-EVO, 
  *  from 24.2-EVO before 24.2R1-S2-EVO, 24.2R2-EVO.




This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 22.4R1-EVO."

This issue requires a BGP session to be established.

This issue can propagate and multiply through multiple ASes until reaching vulnerable devices.

This issue affects iBGP and eBGP.

This issue affects IPv4 and IPv6.

An indicator of compromise may be the presence of malformed update messages in a neighboring AS which is unaffected by this issue:

For example, by issuing the command on the neighboring device:
 show log messages

Reviewing for similar messages from devices within proximity to each other may indicate this malformed packet is propagating:
  rpd[<pid>]: Received malformed update from <IP address> (External AS <AS#>)
and
  rpd[<pid>]: Malformed Attribute"

CVE-2025-21606	hot	exelban	stats	"stats is a macOS system monitor in for the menu bar. The Stats application is vulnerable to a local privilege escalation due to the insecure implementation of its XPC service. The application registers a Mach service under the name `eu.exelban.Stats.SMC.Helper`. The associated binary, eu.exelban.Stats.SMC.Helper, is a privileged helper tool designed to execute actions requiring elevated privileges on behalf of the client, such as setting fan modes, adjusting fan speeds, and executing the `powermetrics` command. The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the `shouldAcceptNewConnection` method, which unconditionally returns YES (or true), allowing any XPC client to connect to the service without any form of verification. As a result, unauthorized clients can establish a connection to the Mach service and invoke methods exposed by the HelperTool interface. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify the hardware settings of the userâs device and execute arbitrary code with root privileges. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.21 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."

CVE-2025-23040	hot	desktop	desktop	"GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials."

CVE-2025-0473	hot	PMB Services	PMB platform	"Vulnerability in the PMB platform that allows an attacker to persist temporary files on the server, affecting versions 4.0.10 and above. This vulnerability exists in the file upload functionality on the /pmb/authorities/import/iimport_authorities endpoint. When a file is uploaded via this resource, the server will create a temporary file that will be deleted after the client sends a POST request to /pmb/authorities/import/iimport_authorities. This workflow is automated by the web client, however an attacker can trap and launch the second POST request to prevent the temporary file from being deleted."
CVE-2025-0058	hot	SAP_SE	SAP Business Workflow and SAP Flexible Workflow	"In SAP Business Workflow and SAP Flexible Workflow, an authenticated attacker can manipulate a parameter in an otherwise legitimate resource request to view sensitive information that should otherwise be restricted.

CVE-2025-0107	hot	Palo Alto Networks	Cloud NGFW	"An OS command injection vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks Expedition enables an unauthenticated attacker to run arbitrary OS commands as the www-data user in Expedition, which results in the disclosure of usernames, cleartext passwords, device configurations, and device API keys for firewalls running PAN-OS software."
CVE-2025-0412	hot	Luxion	KeyShot Viewer	"Luxion KeyShot Viewer KSP File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Luxion KeyShot Viewer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the processing of KSP files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22139."
